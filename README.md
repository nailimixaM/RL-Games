The aim of this repository is to demonstrate the use of machine learning/reinforcement learning techniques to simple games.

tic-tac-toe: [In development] Using temporal-difference learning to train a computer to play this classic game.
- Learning process complete for learner "X" vs random player "O"
- Learning process complete for learner "X" vs learner "O"
- Player versus bot as either "X" or "O" mode after training
- To do: Results analysis (strength with number of trials, learning rate etc)
- To do: refactor/clean up code
